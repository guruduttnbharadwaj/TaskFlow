TaskFlow 
A modern, scalable web application featuring Authentication, a Dashboard, and Task Management. Built with React (Vite) and Node.js.

🚀 Overview

This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a scalable web application. It demonstrates a complete full-stack integration with secure authentication, protected routes, and CRUD operations.

Live Features:

Authentication: Secure Login & Registration using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) & bcrypt for password hashing.

Dashboard: User profile display (Join Date, Username) and real-time task progress tracking.

Task Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update/Toggle, Delete) operations.

Search & Filter: Real-time filtering of tasks via a responsive search bar.

UI/UX: Modern Glassmorphism aesthetics, smooth animations, and responsive design using pure CSS and React.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, Vite, Lucide-React (Icons).

Backend: Node.js, Express.js.

Security: JWT (Authentication), Bcrypt (Password Hashing), CORS.

Database: Portable JSON-based File System (Simulating NoSQL).

📦 Installation & Setup Guide

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

Prerequisites

Node.js installed on your machine.

1. Backend Setup

The backend runs on port 5000 and handles all API requests.

# Navigate to the backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies (Express, CORS, Bcrypt, JWT)
npm install

# Start the server
node server.js


You should see: Backend running on port 5000

2. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal window. The frontend runs on port 5173.

# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies (React, Vite, Lucide)
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev


Click the link shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

ℹ️ Architectural Decisions

Database Strategy (Scalability Note)

For the purpose of this assignment and to ensure maximum portability for the evaluator, I implemented a File-Based JSON Database (backend/database.json).

Why? It allows the application to run immediately on any machine without requiring a local MongoDB service installation or cloud configuration.

Scalability: The code structure is modular. In a production environment, the readDB and writeDB helper functions in server.js can be easily replaced with Mongoose/MongoDB calls without changing the API logic or Frontend.
